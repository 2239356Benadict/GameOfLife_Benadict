#### **Additional Feature One: Health Bar**

The health bar is a feature that could be considered part of the gamification of any application. These types of features could help us evaluate how the user is performing the tasks included in the application. In this project, the health bar is represented using a slider, where the fill area's colour shows the health status. If the area is fully filled with green, it indicates full health, which gradually reduces as the player or manikin hits the fire area. The health bar is provided for the player and all manikins. Considering this as training, and the user needs to save the people trapped in a forest fire, it could help the user understand how well the performance is and can be improved with consistent practice.

#### **Additional Feature Two: Fire Extinguishers**

Another important functionality that is implemented in the fire extinguishing effect from an industrial extinguisher and an aerial extinguisher. Everyone will try to use a fire extinguisher in any real-world firefight situation. Likewise, in this application, the industrial extinguisher is used once the particle collides with the fire to put out the fire. Aerial support does the same.
